# LED-Kunst
This project uses arduino to light up a 16x16 led matrix and show Icons from 3 Topics: Emojis, Flags and Videogames.
This (School) project was done by me (Gabriel Macip) and Leonardo Mocci.

## Hardware
1. Arduino (Mega 2560)
2. Power supply
3. Led matrix (NeoPixel FLexMatrix 16x16 WS2812B RGB LED)

## Software
1. Arduino IDE 1.8.19

## Other Material
1. Wooden box
2. Cables
3. Computer

## Use
1. Arduino: Mini computer used to communicate from the computer to the matrix.
2. Power Supplly: Used to power the matrix because the arduino didn't have enough energy to power the whole 16x16 led matrix.  
3. Led matrix: Used to show the icons.
4. Arduino IDE 1.8.19: Used to programm the arduino (Harware) and write the code.
5. Wooden box: The whole power supply wasn't isolated from electricity (some parts werent safe to touch while it had electricity running through it.) The box was built for safety. So that no one could come in direct contact with the unisolated parts of the power supply.
6. Cables: Used to connect everything with one another: The matrix with the Arduino and the power supply. The arduino with the matrix, the computer and the power supply. The power supply with the matrix, the arduino and to the electrical outlet.
7. Computer: To write the code. At the beginning of the project to order the components.

### The icons + pictures
1. Emojis: Flabergassed, cry, cool, heart eyes-->(in code called "Kiss EM").
2. Flags: Sweden, France, Switzerland, Italy
3. Videogames: Mario, Creeper, storm tropper.

### Pictures/Video 

In the picture you can see the name of the matrix, how much it costs and were it was bought.

When the box was built it looked like that.

Later it was spray painted black for a more appealing look.

That is how the matrix looks like up close.

That is the arduino and the power supply inside of the box.

Those are all the components inside of the box. This was how it all looked before the box was spray painted and we built a support to put the matrix on top of the box.

That is the support for the matrix. You can also see the hole for the cables to connect to the matrix.

Here is a small video were yo can see all the icons being displayed and how it loops when all the icons are done displaying.

### The code

- We reused part of the code that Yvan from https://Brainy-Bits.com ceated.
- All the icons were created by us (Gabriel Macip and Leonardo Mocci)


#### This is my first repository. I would love any feedback on this project and how i could improve for future projects and/or repositories on Github.
